# MavenPizza

Data was queried from multiple tables within the Maven's Pizzas database to evalute the store's sales trends over the course
of one year. Measures include quantity of orders, quantity of pizzas ordered, revenue, quantity of type of pizzas, and price per order.
These measures will help determine popular days of the week, peak and lull hours, sales per quarter, and most and least popular pizzas.
Knowing this information will be useful to the stakeholders for making decsions about potential changes to the hours/days of operation 
and pizza type availability.
